They typically require sufficient amounts of sunlight, water, and nutrient-rich soil to flourish. However, can plants survive without these prerequisites? This chapter discusses “hydroponics,” i.e., the subset of horticulture that deals with soil-less growing methods, and how it can aid plant growth. Additionally, Cobots are utilized to simplify the process and provide further assistance to plant survival. Ultimately, hydroponics and Cobots work in conjunction to create an efficient and effective system for growing plants. Existing traditional farming systems can lead to soil degradation, reduced crop yields, and water scarcity due to high water usage for irrigation. Additionally, the use of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides can contribute to environmental pollution and harm wildlife. Moreover, traditional farming methods often include laborious working hours for the farmers, which might lead to poor health. Cobot-aided hydroponics farming offers numerous advantages that can improve the productivity, sustainability, and efficiency of farming while reducing labor costs and environmental impact."

However, before these expectations can be realized, we must first determine the present hurdles and development needs for collaborative robots from both a technical and a human perspective. Academics manufacturers and distributors of robots, system integrators, consumers, and educators are all involved and responded to an online survey about the deployment of collaborative robots. There is lack of awareness of prospective The most critical factors were applications, source cases, security legislation, and easiness of use—an essential hurdle to using collaborative robots in all categories. New techniques of dividing work between human workers and collaborative robots, as well as safety technology, were the most pressing development needs. There was a mismatch in the responses from representatives from various industries. The current needs of the industry are described in this paper, demonstrating that slightly different challenges have been raised in academics. Aside from discovering new ways to collaborate with collaborative robots, safety is still a problem, and there is a general lack of understanding of collaborative robots in industries."

Objectives We introduced an autonomous, social robot (‘Pepper’) into a project-based learning environment at a public elementary/middle school in order to see how long-term exposure to a robot in a project-based classroom affected student conceptions of robots. Methods We conducted unstructured classroom observations, focus-group interviews with students, and took videos of students interacting with the robot at key points in the project. We engaged in joint coding and memo writing to summarize key themes. Results Our results showed the limitations of these social robots as interactive educational technology, but also revealed the complexity of young adolescent beliefs about robots as social actors. Although current technology limits the ability of robots to be widely deployed in public-school classrooms, skillfully designed interventions using social robots have the potential to motivate and engage students. Takeaways Exposure to the robot stimulated students to discuss robots as social actors, raised issues about gender identification of artificial agents in the classroom, and stimulated discussion on what constitutes a social being. The initial novelty of the humanoid robot enhanced engagement with the longer-term project and also challenged teachers to be more reflective and flexible in planning the project."

The success of an interview depends on the interviewer's theoretical knowledge, preparedness, and communication skills. Practice interviews allow students to apply their knowledge and improve their skills through experience. This practical training is resource-intensive, requiring the time and effort of a stakeholder for each student, which may not be feasible for a large number of students. This paper introduces RoboREIT, an interactive Robotic tutor for Requirements Elicitation Interview Training. RoboREIT addresses the scalability problem of practice sessions with a robotic tutor acting as a stakeholder during the interview and providing feedback after the interview. We performed an exploratory user study to evaluate RoboREIT and demonstrate its applicability in requirements elicitation interview training. The quantitative and qualitative analyses of the users' responses reveal the appreciation of RoboREIT. Our study is the first in the literature that utilizes a social robot in requirements elicitation interview education. RoboREIT's design incorporates replaying faulty interview stages and allows the student to learn from mistakes by a second time practicing. All participants praised the feedback component, which is not present in the state of the art, for being helpful in identifying the mistakes. A favorable response rate of 81\% for the system's usefulness indicates the positive perception of the participants."

The authors propose a novel approach that leverages open-source instant messaging platforms to overcome the complexities and reduce costs associated with implementing a secure and user-centred communication system for remote robot control named Robot Control System using Instant Communication (ROSIC). By leveraging features, such as real-time messaging, group chats, end-to-end encryption and cross-platform support inherent in the majority of instant messenger platforms, we have developed middleware that establishes a secure and efficient communication system over the Internet. By using instant messaging as the communication interface between users and robots, ROSIC caters to non-technical users, making it easier for them to control robots. The architecture of ROSIC enables various scenarios for robot control, including one user controlling multiple robots, multiple users controlling one robot, multiple robots controlled by multiple users, and one user controlling one robot. Furthermore, ROSIC facilitates the interaction of multiple robots, enabling them to interoperate and function collaboratively as a swarm system by providing a unified communication platform that allows for seamless exchange of data and commands. Telegram was specifically chosen as the instant messaging platform by the authors due to its open-source nature, robust encryption, compatibility across multiple platforms and interactive communication capabilities through channels and groups. Notably, the ROSIC is designed to communicate effectively with robot operating system (ROS)-based robots to enhance our ability to control them remotely."

The use of automated robots is a key component of Industry 4.0, which faces difficulty embedding human intellect whenever required. In contrast, cobots are collaborative robots with the inherent ability to integrate artificial intelligence and human intelligence for different decision-making processes. This redirection of human ingenuity into environments in which trained individuals engage with robots is important because market demand and customer needs are abstaining from large-scale production, and consumers are expecting significantly more customization and personalization of the goods they purchase. The involvement of humans facilitates the work of robots in various disruptive activities across several industries. The digital twin, edge computing, fog computing, the Internet-of-Everything, and cobots are the main enabling techniques for implementing Industry 5.0 in reality. Industry 5.0 and collaborative robots herald the dawn of a new era in robotics and industrial production. The success of Industry 5.0 is largely dependent on how well its enabling techniques, like cobots, have been implemented to solve real-time problems. The work carried out in this article is primarily concerned with the role of cobots in the successful implementation of Industry 5.0. The potential applications of cobots in various industries are explored. The industries of interest are the manufacturing industry, the aircraft industry, the healthcare sector, and the banking sector, to name a few. A comparison of the workings of robots and cobots is presented, highlighting the key differences between them. A conceptual cobot-based cyber-physical system is presented. The explicit use of human intelligence in different domains of application is explored. Finally, the risks and security threats to cobots are discussed, along with some mitigation techniques."

In particular, relatively little is known about differences in the organizational and individual factors contributing to counterproductive work behaviors (CWB) among employees working with industrial robots and collaborative robots (cobots). This deficiency highlights the need to deepen our understanding of socially undesirable organizational behaviors that might occur in HRI and their potential correlates to better align with the human-centered focus of the evolving Industry 5.0. The first aim of our study was to investigate whether work characteristics, job satisfaction, and stress at work are related to CWB (overall and in two dimensions—sabotage and withdrawal) in the total sample and the two subgroups, including industrial robot operators and cobot operators. Based on the stressor-emotion model of CWB, we expected that these organizational and individual factors would contribute to CWB among employees working with robots. The second aim of our study was to examine differences in CWB and its potential correlates (i.e., work characteristics, work stress, and job satisfaction) among industrial robot operators and cobot operators. We found no significant correlation between work stress and CWB, including its dimensions of sabotage and withdrawal. However, our results showed that cobot operators reported more favorable physical work conditions and ergonomics, lower work stress, higher job satisfaction, and greater overall CWB compared to industrial robot operators. These results underscore the distinctive psychological dynamics in HRI among industrial robot operators and cobot operators, which might contribute to differences in CWB in both groups of employees. Our study also suggests potential directions for future research on the predictors of CWB and moderators and mediators of the stress-CWB relationship in robotic work environments."

Using autonomous or teleoperated robots allow human workers to be physically removed from these tasks. However, in some situations, it is favorable to have a human worker be physically involved in the task so their cognitive capabilities can be utilized. Advances in robotic technology are leading to new applications of physical human–robot collaboration ( pHRC ), which allows for the strengths of both the human worker and the robot to be utilized as they collaboratively perform tasks. For pHRC tasks to be successful, several considerations need to be made, including the utilization of appropriate control methods, strategies for providing assistance to the human worker and ensuring the interaction is safe.

These robots can perform various tasks, including delivering medications on time, promoting physical activity, and cultivating social connections by contacting family and friends. As the global population ages, healthcare robots are emerging as critical technology to support older adults and alleviate the burden on healthcare systems. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by significant challenges, including inflexible hard-coded functionalities, high development and training costs, and a common lack of cultural adaptability. Extended reality (XR) and digital twin (DT) technologies offer a transformative approach to overcome these hurdles by enabling safe, scalable, and cost-effective virtual training environments. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature at the intersection of XR, DT, and healthcare robotics, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We not only present a thematic analysis of current research but also identify key fundamental challenges in existing robot training methodologies and analyse the field's evolutionary trends through visualisations. Based on our synthesis, we propose a conceptual framework and guidelines for developing future healthcare robots that are not only technologically advanced but also personalised, empathetic, and culturally sensitive. The purpose of this survey is to provide a roadmap for researchers and practitioners to take advantage of these convergent technologies, with the intention of creating a more effective and humane healthcare ecosystem for ageing populations around the world."

The first part of this chapter is devoted to giving a brief overview of the history and contemporary issues in human–robot collaborations, while highlighting four key factors: task architecture, team formation, human modeling in the aspect of decision and control, and human modeling of other factors. This chapter presents not only research advances in academia but also technological advances in industry with some real use cases of human–robot collaborations in factories. We then review two of our recent research outcomes, namely (i) human-enabled multirobot navigation, and (ii) operation support with variable autonomy for remote harvesting. In the former, we address a complementary interaction between a human and a network of multiple robots, during which we present a distributed control architecture based on the well-established concept of passivity. In the latter, we address an overlapping human–robot interaction and design an online autonomy determination mechanism based on Gaussian process, a machine learning technique. In both sections, we conduct user studies to examine human passivity, human workload, and human usability. We conclude by providing our vision for the future of human–robot collaborations."

Materials and Methods Fully edentulous and terminal dentition patients were enrolled for r-CAIS technology. Based on the cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) examination, a customized positioning marker and a preoperative surgical plan were created before surgery. During the implant surgery, the implant osteotomy and placement were automatically performed using an autonomous robotic surgery system under the surgeon's supervision. A postoperative CBCT scan was used to determine the discrepancies between the planned and placed implants. Results Ten patients with 59 implants underwent autonomous robotic surgery. No adverse surgical events occurred. The deviations of global coronal, global apical, and angular were 0.67 ± 0.37 mm (95\% CI: 0.58–0.77 mm), 0.69 ± 0.37 mm (95\% CI: 0.59–0.78 mm), and 1.27° ± 0.59° (95\% CI: 1.42°–1.11°), respectively. Conclusions The autonomous r-CAIS technology proved an accurate surgical approach for implant placement in fully edentulous patients due to the control of the angular deviation. Autonomous robotic surgery seems promising as an accurate technology for treating fully edentulous patients. However, further trials are required to provide more hard clinical evidence."

The classical biopsy operation involves the registration of magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) information taken from the patient at different times. Typically, the surgeon's planning information, which takes an average of 4 h on MR, is transferred to CT, and the surgical operation commences. However, this approach necessitates two separate acquisitions (MR and CT), adversely affecting patient comfort and increasing the workload. In the proposed system, it is recommended to register MR-Depth camera data instead of MR-CT registration. To achieve this, a 3D face pattern is obtained from the data received from the depth camera attached to the robot arm and overlapped with the mesh obtained by segmentation of the MR. It was observed that registration with sub-millimeter precision was achieved using the CMFreg surface registration technique."

This required a thorough risk assessment following international standards. This study presents a systematic review of previous research on safety considerations in the design of robotic systems, concentrating exclusively on peer-reviewed articles. A search method was developed to collect relevant articles, using keywords such as safety, fault, risk evaluation, safety evaluation, risk assessment, and ergonomics, among others. The keyword “robot” was utilized to bias the search results, which helped to narrow down collected articles to papers directly related to robotics. The risk assessment process includes recognizing machine shortcomings, recognizing threats, evaluating risk, and articulating a standardized computerized risk strategy. Mathematical analysis plays a crucial role in assessing the technical and social behavior of robots in different applications. Generally, injury associated with robots arises from errors during risk assessment. The Risk Ranking Number (HRN) is employed to quantify the degree of safety, incorporating factors like the possibility of occurrence and magnitude of potential hazard. In robot design, the main attention should be on minimizing/eradicating physical hazards and optimizing control mechanisms. Algorithms like force limitation and obstacle avoidance can minimize injury risk, especially during robot–human interactions. The review underscores the critical importance of establishing comprehensive risk assessment frameworks and utilizing safety models, algorithms, and functions as crucial tools to safeguard the integrity and security of robotic systems."

Firstly, the YOLOMS network was used to realize the 3D localization of picking points for single mangoes and mango clusters in unstructured environments. Secondly, a new “shearing and grasping integrated” end-effector for non-destructive harvesting of mangoes was designed. Then, a task division method for the workspace of the dual robotic arm harvesting robot was proposed to minimize the likelihood of collisions between dual arms. Additionally, a depth-first picking strategy was introduced to reduce fruit damage and enhance the success rates of picking mangoes from layered canopies. Finally, a mango harvesting robotic system with dual arms was developed and integrated. The performance of the system was evaluated by field mango picking experiments. The results showed that the average recognition rate and planning success rate of the harvesting robot were 83.94\% and 98.45\%, respectively. In addition, the average harvesting success rate of the robot was 73.92\%, and the average single-fruit harvesting time was 8.93 s. Compared with the robot with single arm, the harvesting time was reduced by 48.38\%, which indicated that the harvesting efficiency of the dual robotic arm harvesting robot was significantly improved. The average collision-free harvesting rate with the addition of the depth-first harvesting strategy was 91.68\%, which verified the rationality and effectiveness of the dual robotic arm collaborative mango harvesting robotic system. The results provide technical support for automated mango harvesting."

The chapter “Beyond Earth's Horizon: AI's Contribution to Space Exploration” delves into AI's pivotal role in advancing our understanding of the cosmos and enhancing the efficiency and safety of space missions. This exploration is grounded on a comprehensive overview of AI's applications in space exploration, from mission planning and autonomous navigation to data analysis and extraterrestrial research. The chapter begins by tracing the evolution of AI in space exploration, highlighting key milestones such as the use of AI in early satellite missions and its growing presence in contemporary space endeavors. As space missions become increasingly complex and distant, the need for autonomous systems that can operate independently of Earth-based control becomes paramount. AI emerges as a critical tool in this context, enabling spacecraft to make real-time decisions, optimize navigation routes, and manage unforeseen challenges in environments where communication delays are significant. One of the primary focuses of the chapter is on AI-driven navigation systems. These systems are designed to perform tasks such as trajectory optimization, hazard avoidance, and precision landing on celestial bodies. The chapter examines the sophisticated algorithms that power these systems, allowing spacecraft to navigate through the vast expanse of space with unprecedented accuracy. Case studies of missions like NASA's Mars rovers, the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission, and upcoming projects aimed at exploring asteroids and distant planets illustrate the practical applications of AI in enhancing mission success rates. In addition to navigation, AI's role in data analysis is thoroughly explored. Space missions generate vast amounts of data, much of which needs to be processed and analyzed in real time. AI techniques, including machine learning and neural networks, are employed to sift through these data, identify patterns, and extract meaningful insights. These capabilities are crucial for tasks such as analyzing planetary surfaces, detecting signs of extraterrestrial life, and understanding the complex dynamics of celestial phenomena. The chapter also discusses AI's potential in processing data from space telescopes and other observational platforms, contributing to discoveries that expand our knowledge of the universe. The chapter further explores AI's contribution to robotic exploration and the development of autonomous systems capable of performing scientific experiments, repairs, and maintenance in space. These systems are designed to operate in harsh and unpredictable environments, where human intervention is limited or impossible. AI-driven robots and drones are set to play a significant role in future missions, from constructing habitats on the Moon and Mars to exploring the outer reaches of our solar system. In conclusion, the chapter emphasizes the transformative impact of AI on space exploration and navigation. As we venture beyond Earth's horizon, AI not only enhances the efficiency and safety of space missions but also opens new avenues for discovery. The continued integration of AI in space exploration promises to accelerate our journey into the cosmos, pushing the boundaries of what humanity can achieve."

The aim of this five-stage scoping review was to address this knowledge gap by identifying factors influencing nurses’ acceptance of welfare technologies, both before and after using them. A search of seven bibliographic databases and grey literature was conducted in December 2022, and based on defined selection criteria, 27 sources published between 2007 and 2022 were then considered. The data were examined with ATLAS.ti 9 using content-based analysis, and five groups of acceptance factors were identified: individual, organisational, patient, technological, and social influence. Post-use acceptance factors were found to be more nuanced than pre-use factors. While the pre-use factors included mainly attitudes, needs, outcome expectations, and ethical concerns, the post-use factors more prominently featured experience, usefulness, technical issues, device characteristics, effort expectancy, and organisational factors. Nevertheless, patient-centeredness was reflected in both. This study contributes to a better understanding of the factors affecting nurses’ acceptance of welfare technologies in the care of older adults in non-clinical settings, and it underscores the patient’s pivotal role in all aspects of nursing practice. By offering insights into both pre-use and post-use factors, this study gives an enriched perspective on the acceptance of welfare technologies in nursing care and provides guidance for future research and practice."

The growth of productivity of goods and services is directly related to the economy. Manpower, machinery, tools, and costs have drastically improved according to the developing technologies. The term Industry 5.0 refers to a scenario where people make use of advanced technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, and smart machines for effective productivity. This development is more advantageous like providing low-cost products, improved wages, and transportation of goods from rural to urban areas. Since industries are dependent on smart devices, and automated environments, energy consumption and data privacy have become a challenge nowadays. To resolve these issues, blockchain technology provides a decentralized network where the information and transactions are encrypted and stored as blocks. Each block undergoes data validation through the mining process and gets added to the chain of blocks as a blockchain. This is a distributed ledger where a copy of a transaction is distributed across the network to maintain data transparency and immutability. Supply chain management, digital twinning, and secure data exchange among the stakeholders are some of the applications of blockchain in Industries 5.0. This enhances traceability, transparency, and quality control in the supply chain because of its tamper-proof property. Every transaction is securely recorded in the form of smart contracts which automate contracts that increase the efficiency of the system from malicious attacks. Digital twinning is another concept where a digital replica of the physical world is created and data are updated and synchronized accordingly. Thus, the implementation of blockchain technology in Industry 5.0 guarantees data security and privacy, which builds confidence among industrialists and increases efficiency."

Socially assistive robots (SARs) offer a promising approach to enhance social connection and emotional well-being in this population. This study aimed to examine the feasibility, acceptability and potential psychosocial impact of a 16-week, home-based use of a conversational SAR in cognitively impaired older adults living alone. Methods This was a single-arm, exploratory feasibility study involving home installation of a humanoid conversational robot (RoBoHoN) for 16 weeks. Usability was assessed with the System Usability Scale (SUS). Psychosocial outcomes, including loneliness (UCLA-LS3) and depressive symptoms (GDS-15), were measured pre- and post-intervention. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and analysed using hybrid content analysis to explore user experiences. Results A total of 11 participants were enrolled, including individuals with mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia and late-onset psychosis; nine completed the study. The mean age was 81.9 years, with an age range of 71–89 years. The mean SUS score was 81.7, indicating high usability even among cognitively impaired users. Small-to-moderate effect sizes were observed for reductions in loneliness and depressive symptoms (UCLA-LS3: r = 0.40; GDS-15: r = 0.64), although not statistically significant. Qualitative findings highlighted perceived companionship and increased opportunities to speak, while also noting limitations such as poor conversational depth, delayed responses and technical issues like battery depletion or sensitivity to background noise. Conclusions The 16-week home-based use of a conversational robot was feasible and well accepted by older adults with cognitive impairment living alone. Although preliminary, findings suggest potential psychosocial benefits of SARs in this population. These results support the rationale for conducting a controlled trial targeting loneliness and depression in cognitively impaired, socially isolated older adults."

The concept of hikikomori, a severe social withdrawal condition, has gained increasing attention in high-income societies and developed economies. The term applies to both the condition and the person experiencing it. Technology has been blamed for exacerbating the isolation of hikikomoris. Paradoxically, anecdotal evidence suggests that technology can help mitigate their social withdrawal. Drawing on affordance theory, this study explores the potential of technology as an intermediate intervention to help hikikomoris reintegrate into society by addressing the research question—“How are the affordances of technology leveraged to contribute to the gradual reintegration of hikikomoris into society?” This netnographic study is based on over 2-year naturalistic observations of the Hikikomori Escape online community. Our findings identified seven types of affordances that facilitate Hikikomoris' social reintegration journey: anonymous storytelling, meta connectivity, information access for skill growth, peer networking and community building, online coaching, virtual-to-real connectivity, and tech-enabled skill development. We discuss how three levels of technology affordances shape hihikomoris' self-motivation to connect socially at the individual and community levels, facilitating their gradual reintegration into society. This research contributes by developing an empirically grounded framework of how technology can contribute to addressing social withdrawal among hikikomoris. Such knowledge is crucial for scholars, policymakers, and health professionals seeking to tackle this pressing societal challenge."

These autonomous, physically embodied, and adaptable robots engage in diverse interactions, from patient care to goods delivery and hospitality services. However, the deployment of increasingly capable service robots demands not only designing user–robot interactions, but also holistic innovation management that transcends organizational boundaries and involves various societal stakeholders. Our research draws on the emerging Public Value Theory to examine the types of service robots and the innovation ecosystems that harness the expertise of public and private stakeholders and produce Public Value. Based on literature and an illustrative case study, we conceptualize service robots along characteristics such as autonomy, aesthetics, assistive roles, and user interfaces, and introduce Service Robot-based Innovation as the ecosystem-enabled development and employment of such robots. The service robot's autonomy and ecosystem integration are key dimensions determining innovation management practices and Public Value creation. The illustrative case, centered on long-term care, dissects the integration of service robots across the micro (user), meso (organizational), and macro (societal) levels of the ecosystem. An ecosystem-as-structure approach identifies the roles and activities of stakeholders aligning around a shared value proposition of Public Value. A research agenda presents future opportunities within and across various ecosystem levels to advance scholarly understanding of Service Robot-based Innovation."

Yet, despite its potential, there is limited empirical research on the use of AI in K-12 settings exploring the pedagogical grounding, impact and implications of the technological solutions. The current paper reports a systematic literature review of 28 papers that addresses the topic of AI technologies in authentic settings. We applied etic and emic content analysis to the collected data. Our results indicated that most AI research is conducted in China and the United States, and investigates AI solutions for primary education. As main AI technologies we found social robots, augmented reality and intelligent systems. The review also revealed that half of the papers lack a solid pedagogical foundation and a contextualisation under concrete course conditions. Finally, most AI solutions focus mainly on learning outcomes without exploring the teacher needs and impressions. Our findings suggest the need for research to focus on: (a) AIEd localisation to fit the AI context of different regions; (b) contextualisation of the tool design under several course conditions and learning theories; (c) equal attention on teacher agency and autonomy within the AIEd era; and (d) systematisation of the evaluation of sustained pedagogical effects (e.g., cognitive, relational, affective effects) apart from student learning outcomes. We envision that our research can support the design, development and deployment of AI tools in K-12 under such pedagogical considerations, hence contributing to strengthen the ties between pedagogy and AI practices in authentic settings."

The proposed framework consists of three key modules: human motion intention recognition, disturbance rejection control, and obstacle avoidance, all of which are crucial for SRLs in the process of HRC. First, a motion intention method based on the autoregressive model is proposed to predict human motion, to improve task execution during HRC. Second, a control strategy based on a Tanh-type Barrier Lyapunov function is introduced to ensure bounded outputs and smooth operation in physical interactions with environment. Third, to enhance the collaboration between SRL and humans, dynamic obstacle avoidance based on human skeleton recognition and inverse kinematics is incorporated into the framework. The proposed framework is demonstrated by the human-SRL collaborative task, and the experimental results indicated that the performances can be improved with our framework."

This review will focus on identifying potential enabling technologies of Industry 5.0 that could be harnessed to shape the future of food in the coming years. We will review the state-of-the-art studies on the use of innovative technologies in various food and agriculture applications over the last 5 years. In addition, opportunities and challenges will be highlighted, and future directions and conclusions will be drawn. Preliminary evidence suggests that Industry 5.0 is the outcome of an evolutionary process and not of a revolution, as is often claimed. Our results show that regenerative and/or conversational artificial intelligence, the Internet of Everything, miniaturized and nanosensors, 4D printing and beyond, cobots and advanced drones, edge computing, redactable blockchain, metaverse and immersive techniques, cyber-physical systems, digital twins, and sixth-generation wireless and beyond are likely to be among the main driving technologies of Food Industry 5.0.

In this new chapter within the feminist sex war, the authors of this article tend to agree with anti-sex-robot concerns and seek to further identify potential harms of sex robots. However, instead of characterizing the harm in terms of what the robots represent and symbolize, we are primarily interested in the internal state of the user and the type of relationship that will emerge between human users and sex robots, which we argue is an unprecedented sexual relation. Unlike other comparable sex products and services, sex robots occupy a liminal space between being perceived as both a sexual property and agent, oscillating based on the preferences and convenience of the user. We argue that this oscillation that enables human–sex robot intimacy requires self-deception, which in turn entails individual moral responsibility. Thus, we articulate a novel virtue-based approach of examining human–robot intimacy that focuses on cultivating erotic flourishing. We conclude that people have a moral responsibility to exhibit self-awareness within the dynamics of their intimate relationship with sex robots and the (contradictory) beliefs required to maintain such intimacy."

This argument is the product of a narrative literature review that examined assistive robots deployed in care settings. We found that although the deployment of healthcare robots has redefined the concept of care, as featured in geography, legal studies, and philosophy, it rarely appears in sociological inquiry. There are three fields that this approach to a sociology of health and illness complements. These are (1) phenomenology and the new approaches to touch and recognition in embodied relations with robots, (2) biopolitics, where the governance of life is conceptualised as a conjunction between the biological and artificial and (3) the reconfiguration of healthcare labour around mutuality, where robots both maintain and are maintained by the human. We end by suggesting that the increased implementation of robotics into care work provides a broader sociological opportunity for addressing how boundaries of ‘human’ can be rethought alongside new healthcare technologies."

Drawing on psychological ownership theory and the theory of commitment, we find that consumer ownership significantly increases adoption intention by fostering a stronger sense of commitment to the product. In a series of three studies, we demonstrate that real ownership (Study 1, N = 120, Survey) and perceived ownership (Study 2, N = 200, Experiment) both enhance adoption intentions. Furthermore, Study 3 (N = 200, Experiment) reveals that the impact of ownership is moderated by the type of AI assistant. Specifically, the effect is stronger for functional AI assistants but disappears for companion AI assistants. This research provides valuable strategies for businesses to increase AI adoption."

It proposes a way to navigate these dual features by bringing African and Western personhood into conversation, building on the strengths of each approach, and developing a new view of personhood that we call, Emergent Personhood.

The focus of the literature review is on identifying the growing influence of AI in e-CPS that supports both technical and human levels. This helps in analyzing data, drawing conclusions, making predictions, and overall making better judgments using a set of tools called artificial intelligence (AI). Consequently, several academic and business articles were reviewed to support the conclusions. Natural sciences and social sciences differ from one another, making it impossible to apply traditional scientific procedures to social sciences. However, this example might be improved with the application of AI and knowledge technology in general in economics. It may evaluate its effect on the real world by simulating human behavior. Making more accurate predictions as well as spotting financial bubbles and other possible economic weaknesses may be made simpler as a result. While its instruments can violate privacy protections, its algorithms have the potential to strengthen already biased practices. Adhering to values like responsibility, transparency, and fairness will help address these flaws."

This identifies the smallest bounding boxes that encompass the objects of interest within the input images. Nevertheless, these approaches face challenges, like limited support for quantization and suboptimal trade in achieving accurate object detection. To address these issues, a novel approach called Faster region-based Convoluted Non-monopolize search You Only Look Once neural architecture Search (FCN-YOLOS) is introduced for object detection. This approach merges the advanced feature abstraction abilities of Faster R-CNN with the efficient object recognition strengths of YOLOv8, enhanced by NAS optimization. YOLOv8 is employed for its rapid and accurate real-time detection of abandoned items, while Faster R-CNN contributes sophisticated feature extraction by utilizing statistical, grid, and Histogram of Oriented Optical Flow (HOOF) features to improve object representation and classification. Additionally, NAS optimizes hyperparameters by balancing exploration and exploitation, which helps minimize the loss function, reduce overfitting, and enhance generalization. This results in exceptional real-time object detection performance within the FCN-YOLOS framework. The proposed technique has demonstrated a maximum image of approximately 99\%, 96.3\%, 94.9\%, and 95.2\% concerning brightness realization compared to existing methods for accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score, respectively. These outcomes highlight its extensive applicability across diverse object detection contexts, rendering it a compelling option for both academic and industrial research. Overall, the proposed approach for object recognition techniques in feature extraction and hyperparameter adjustments further improves evaluation in terms of efficiency and object detection accuracy."

In contrast to conventional manual inspection techniques, recent automated inspection systems employ deep learning models trained to detect defects rapidly and precisely. The development of these models often requires a substantial image dataset to acquire adequate knowledge of defect features and enhance their predictive accuracy. When data is limited, augmentation techniques are often used to improve the precision and accuracy of defect detection systems. This study examined the prediction performance of two object detection models, namely Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) and You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8), to identify dent defects in limited images of cast iron cylinder head surfaces. The original image set contains 46 images with 563 dents. To overcome limited data availability, common image augmentation techniques along with a copy-paste method were applied. Results show that standard augmentation improved YOLOv8 accuracy by 8.00\% and average precision (AP) by 3.00\%. On the other hand, the copy-paste technique achieved a 20.00\% increase in accuracy and a 1\% increase in AP with just 200 synthetic dents. These results provide support for using the copy-paste augmentation strategy to enhance defect detection performance, with a limited dataset, contributing to more accurate defect identification in remanufacturing processes."

However, previous literature has not paid enough attention to AI-involved teaching patterns, and it is necessary to evaluate the effects of this learning pattern. Objectives Based on the social presence theory and the community of inquiry model, the main purpose of this study is to evaluate whether and how interaction frequency with chatbots (IFC) affects people's learning autonomy (LA) under two preferences: knowledge acquisition and virtual companionship, and whether social presence (SP) plays a mediating role. Methods The 1-year longitudinal study was designed to be conducted from May 2022 to May 2023 and included three rounds of surveys of 1155 undergraduate students on their use of robots for learning. Results and Conclusions For learners preferring virtual companionship, no direct correlation was found between IFC and LA. However, SP acted as a mediating factor, enhancing LA through increased chatbot interactions. This suggests that while direct interactions may not directly influence LA, the resulting SP can foster it. Conversely, for learners favouring knowledge acquisition, higher IFC negatively impacted both SP and LA. Despite this, a strong sense of SP consistently correlated positively with LA, indicating it could offset some negative effects of frequent chatbot use."

According to self-determination theory (SDT), the fulfilment of three basic psychological needs (BPNs)—autonomy, competence and relatedness—is key to autonomous motivation. However, it is hard to provide personalised support to BPNs in self-directed out-of-class reading. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), with its capacity for generative human-like outputs, makes the provision of personalised interactive support possible. This study thus examined how GenAI-powered chatbots can be utilised to serve as reading companions to fulfil BPNs in self-directed out-of-class reading. An online reading platform was developed, where students engaged in self-directed out-of-class reading. Sixty-nine students from two classes at a Chinese university were randomly assigned to two reading conditions: the experimental group (EG; N = 36) where students had access to a GenAI-powered chatbot as a reading companion on the platform; and the control group (CG; N = 33) where students did not have access to the GenAI-powered chatbot during reading. Multiple data sources were collected and analysed, including pre- and post-reading tests, pre- and post-questionnaires on reading motivation and self-directed out-of-class reading, log data on reading amounts and semi-structured interviews. The findings revealed that EG showed significant improvement in autonomous reading motivation and self-directed out-of-class reading. Reading performance did not differ between the two groups. This study offers valuable evidence on the efficacy of integrating GenAI chatbots into SDL through the lens of SDT. Pedagogically, educators can leverage GenAI technology to cater to students' BPNs, bolstering their SDL capabilities and academic achievement. Practitioner notes What is already known about the topic Self-directed learning (SDL) has been recognised as a crucial competence for academic success and lifelong learning. Motivation has been a major challenge in self-directed out-of-class reading, with the fulfilment of basic psychological needs (BPNs) identified as vital for autonomous motivation according to self-determination theory (SDT). Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has the potential to fulfil students' BPNs by providing personalised interactive support to enhance their motivation and SDL. What this paper adds This study adopted the theoretical lens of SDT to develop a GenAI-empowered online reading platform with a companion chatbot named Reade, aiming to fulfil students' BPNs in self-directed out-of-class reading. This study examined the efficacy of the designed chatbot-assisted BPNs (CaBPNs) in supporting self-directed out-of-class reading. This study offers empirical evidence that CaBPNs support can enhance students' reading motivation and self-directed out-of-class reading. Implications for practice and/or policy Educators should capitalise on the potential of GenAI chatbots in fulfilling learners' BPNs through the provision of personalised interactive support to boost autonomous motivation and SDL. Educators should be aware of the role of AI literacy in leveraging the full potential of chatbot support for SDL and take proactive steps to cultivate learners' AI literacy."

This research delves into a neglected question: How can we enhance the probability of potential users, especially those grappling with loneliness, connecting with companion robots to fulfill their social needs? Building upon the friendliness–dominance model and attraction theory in social psychology, our six studies reveal that individuals experiencing greater loneliness hold generally less favorable attitudes toward the idea of adopting robotic companionship. However, lonelier individuals show a higher inclination to bond with robots that act submissive rather than dominant ones.

In this research, we explore whether, how, and when employees' robot usage affects supervisors' performance ratings. Drawing upon attribution theory, we suggest that supervisors might overestimate the performance of employees who use robots at work. Across a pilot study, two experiments, and one field study, we find that employees' robot usage is positively associated with supervisors' illusory performance transference (i.e., supervisors' belief that robot–associated performance should be attributed to employees who use robots at work). In turn, this transference is positively associated with high performance ratings for the respective employees. Furthermore, the supervisor–perceived experience of robots (i.e., supervisors' perceptions that robots are able to feel emotions and sensations) weakens this indirect effect. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our findings and future directions."

This topic has been reviewed by many literatures, which are characterized by a single perspective and lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks. Thus, the concept and developmental trajectory of traversability evaluation are initially outlined in this paper, distinguishing it from other issues, while constructing an evaluation framework based on two categories: direct assessment and downstream task assessment. Subsequently, traversability evaluation methods are classified based on multiple dimensions, including sensor types, robot types, usage scenarios, and learning approaches. On the basis of the constructed evaluation framework, comparisons are made among existing algorithms in terms of performance and runtime. Subsequently, a summary is provided on commonly used features and their mainstream computation methods in terrain evaluation. Additionally, open-source data sets in this field and projects for scene construction and algorithm validation are compiled and organized. Finally, an analysis is conducted on the development direction and trends, emphasizing the urgent need to establish standardized evaluation systems and comparison baselines. Furthermore, it is imperative that various environmental and platform information be comprehensively integrated into algorithms, while also ensuring that simulation, demonstration, and exploration are incorporated into a unified framework to enhance the robot's learning capability."

This study provides groundbreaking insights into customer experience in immersive metaverse environments, as well as into how these experiences on metaverse platforms influence customers' real-world consumption behaviors. Drawing upon data from metaverse platform users in the US, this study identifies the specific antecedents of a positive customer experience on metaverse platforms, including the role of social presence and trialability. Further, it demonstrates the potential for purchase spillovers from the metaverse to traditional retail channels, extending the omnichannel retail literature. In addition, it examines how early-stage versus long-term users of the metaverse shape users' intentions to revisit metaverse platforms. Based on our results, we offer a comprehensive model of customers' metaverse behaviors, which may be used to predict and enhance customers' purchase intentions across channels. Our results also demonstrate that the metaverse is not merely a parallel digital retail channel but instead an influential extension of the customers' real-world consumption. From a managerial perspective, we offer metaverse operators and retail brand managers insights into how an engaging and immersive customer experience in the metaverse can be developed to support metaverse platform growth, and targeted brand strategies that translate into real-world gain for both the brand and the customer. The findings suggest that metaverse platforms must deliver customer experiences at a very high level to prevent stagnation in metaverse usage intentions; therefore, managers can confidently continue investing in relevant strategies to fuel metaverse platform growth."
