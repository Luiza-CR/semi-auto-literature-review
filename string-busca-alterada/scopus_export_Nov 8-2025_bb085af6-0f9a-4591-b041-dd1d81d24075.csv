They react differently, some interested, some disinterested, some lethargic, some panicked. Research needs to turn more to animalrobot relationships, and to work with engineers to design these relationships in ways that promote animal welfare and reduce animal suffering. This chapter is about social robots that are designed for animals, but also those that—for different, rather unpredictable reasons—meet, interact, and communicate with animals. It also considers animal-friendly machines that have emerged in the context of machine ethics. In the discussion section, the author explores the question of which of the presented robots are to be understood as social robots and what their differences are in their purpose and in their relationship to animals. In addition, social and ethical aspects are addressed. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105018279567"

Introducing swarm-based robot systems for processes such as soil cultivation, sowing, and harvesting comes with new operation scenarios requiring operators to monitor several machines simultaneously. Conventional user interfaces may not be able to cope with the associated change in information and interaction requirements. However, a successful transformation towards such automation scenarios depends on a suitable interaction design that considers human factors such as situation awareness, trust, mental models, and workload. Through efficient navigation architectures or visualisation techniques, user interfaces can counter the impeding effects of humans being out-of-the-loop in multi-robot represent a promising approach to address these issues. Instead of function-based information presentation in conventional user interfaces, goal-oriented approaches highlight the role of machine functions and states in the context of higher-level performance goals. This approach provides opportunities to support operators in understanding the underlying relations between machine functions and their effects on goals such as production performance or efficiency. This article presents the development and evaluation of a goal-oriented user interface for monitoring and controlling highly automated combine harvesters. A hierarchical information visualisation summarised machine data into high-level performance indicators. This visualisation approach also enables operators to access information and control options at different levels of depth to facilitate their situation assessment efforts in continuous switching of loops in multi-robot monitoring. However, fundamentally changing visual and functional characteristics of user interfaces may contradict performance, as they require operators to adapt. A good fit to the operators’ mental models of high-level processes is required to achieve acceptable levels of intuitiveness and acceptance. To evaluate this alternative approach to user interface design, we observed experienced and novice operators working with a functional and interactive prototype and measured perceived usefulness, usability and user experience. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007836185"

As with all new technologies, there is often push-back when changing approaches and initiating new pathways within company operations, which can cause hesitation and even halt the adoption process. This paper draws from interviews with agricultural companies that have previously attempted to implement robots requiring direct human interaction, focusing on individuals within those companies who had decision-making capabilities during the implementation process. From these interviews, a set of action principles has been developed based on transferable knowledge found within the participating companies. The main results of this user study highlight that previous implementation attempts, whether positive or negative, influence future adoption. The study also identifies the multitude of barriers surrounding the agricultural sector's adoption of these technologies and suggests potential actions for companies to take to minimize the issues associated with implementing HRI robots. By identifying common successes and failures and contextualizing them for other companies to follow, this study aims to utilize lessons learned from past implementation attempts to shorten the learning curve and reduce hesitation in adopting HRI robots within the agricultural sector. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004876736"

This article presents a new step in the development of autonomous agricultural machine with a concept and the realization of a novel test method using a dynamic test stand on an agricultural farm in outdoor areas. With this test method, commercially available sensor systems are tested in a long-term test around the clock for 365 days a year and 24 h a day on a dynamic test stand in continuous outdoor use. A test over a longer period of time is needed to test as much as possible all occurring environmental conditions. This test is determined by the naturally occurring environmental conditions. This fact corresponds to the reality of unpredictable/determinable environmental conditions in the field and makes the test method and test stand so unique. The focus of the developed test methods is on creating own real environment detection areas (REDAs) for each sensor system, which can be used to compare and evaluate the autonomous human detection of the sensor systems for the functional safety of autonomous agricultural robots with a humanoid test target.

In unstructured and dangerous environments such as disaster scene, military fields or chemical spray in agricultural farms, the experience and intelligence of the operator are necessary for making complex decisions beyond the autonomy of the robot. In such cases, teleoperation allow the operator to guide the robot in achieving complex task from a safe location. The effectiveness with which the operator controls the robot depends on, among others, operator’s awareness of the robot’s environment, the quality of communication link, the robustness of robot’s control system and experience of the human operator. Ground mobile robots form the basis of this work since they are applicable in many fields and mostly operate in dynamic environments that require additional guidance from a human operator. This study reviews research work on mobile robot teleoperation systems, and puts more emphasis on the architecture, communication link and situation awareness creation. Moreover, future trend in mobile robot teleoperation is also put forward in this review to give ground for new research work in this field. Based on the sited literature, it is noted that making the operator feel present in the robot’s environment through sufficient visual and force feedback as well as use of good quality network, significantly improve the navigation efficiency and task achievement of mobile ground robots. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093838441"

In countries such as Chile and Peru, avocado is one of the main fruit production, but its growing in complex environments, making it difficult to fully automate the harvesting process. In this scenario, human-robot interaction (HRI) strategies can provide solutions to enhance the farming process. In this work, we propose the use of a HRI strategy via three visual non-verbal communication methods, with the aim of improving the avocado harvesting process leading to possible human workload decrement. Using such HRI directives, a robot motion controller is implemented for the robotic service unit to ensure that the interaction is socially acceptable during the avocado transportation task. The robot social navigation is tested in a simulated environment where the robot interacts with field workers to test three control tasks which are approaching, following and avoiding the human. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065644900"

This article focused on a robot tractor associating with human-drive tractor system. A robot tractor is doing farm operation while a human-drive tractor following and doing different operation. Human can adjust the parameters of the robot by a microcontroller. To ensure safety, four cameras were mounted around the robot tractor, and the images of the cameras were sent through wireless video transmission system. Human can keep a watchful eye on the surroundings of the robot tractor. The results of the system indicated that the performance of the robot tractor behaves better than an experienced farmer driver, in the mean while the efficiency is increased compared with a single robot system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896358129"

Based on a short description of the greenhouse crop production process, the current state in greenhouse mechanization and the challenges for robotics in protected cultivation are identified. Examples of current greenhouse robotics research are presented. Since the complex working environment constitutes a considerable challenge to robotics, opportunities will be identified to deal with this complexity. Solutions can be found in developing more advanced technology, including multiple sensor approaches, sensor fusion and artificial intelligence concepts and in human-robot collaboration. Alternatively, solutions can be found in modifying the working environment. The paper also pleas for the development of more generic solutions to deal with the small and very scattered markets of robots in protected cultivation.
